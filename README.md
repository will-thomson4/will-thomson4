# Hi, I'm Will ðŸ‘‹

### I work as a software engineer at PolyAI in London.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on some interesting machine learning projects, but I like making things pretty, so expect these projects to be wrapped in a full-stack web app with plenty of animations.

- ðŸŒ± I'm looking to learn more about **Rust**, **Go** and **Cybersecurity**.
