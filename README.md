# Hi, I'm Will 👋

I'm a full stack engineer, based in London, currently working at PolyAI, working on building real-time, generative ai for customer service automation. 

#### Tech Stack:
Python, Typescript, NodeJs, React, NextJs. But I've also dabbled in C++, Flutter and Swift.


- 🌱 Looking to learn more about animation design, machine learning visualisations and generative image/audio.
